## S3
- store objects in buckets
- buckets need to have global unique name
- buckets are defined at region level
- global service but buckets are in regions
- Objects have a key > key is the full path
- Key > prefix + object name -> basically directories
- max size is 5TB
- if any file uploaded is more than 5 gb > upload in parts
- Objects: metadata, tags, version ID

### Security
1. User based - IAM policies
2. Resource based - bucket policies >bucket level rules > JSON based policies
                  - Object access control list
                   - Bucket ACL
Encrypt the objects using encryption keys
