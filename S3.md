## S3
- store objects in buckets
- buckets need to have global unique name
- buckets are defined at region level
- global service but buckets are in regions
- Objects have a key > key is the full path
- Key > prefix + object name -> basically directories
- max size is 5TB
- if any file uploaded is more than 5 gb > upload in parts
- Objects: metadata, tags, version ID

### Security
1. User based - IAM policies
2. Resource based - bucket policies >bucket level rules > JSON based policies
                  - Object access control list
                   - Bucket ACL
Encrypt the objects using encryption keys

- Static website hosting can be done on S3
- Can version files on bucket level > easy to rollback changes basically
3. Bucket policies - S3 bucket policies are JSON-based access control policies that define permissions for a bucket and its objects. They control access at the bucket level, allowing you to manage who can perform specific actions on your S3 resources.

**Replication**
-copying is asynchronous
- to replicate existing objects - S3 object repl
- only new objects after enabling replication can be replicated

**Storage classes**
1. Standard - freq access, high availability, high cost, high durability (11 9's)
2. Intelligent tiering - moves data between access tiers according to storage. Use case - unpredictable access patterns
3. Standard IA - infrequently accessed data with rapid access when needed; retrieval cost is additional; use case -disaster recovery
4. One zone IA - infrequently accessed data in single zone
5. Glacier instant retrieval: Archive data requiring occasional access with millisecond retrieval. Use Case: Archived data that requires immediate retrieval, like medical records or media assets.
6. Glacier flexible retrieval: Archive data with occasional access and variable retrieval speeds. Use Case: Cost-sensitive data archiving with occasional access needs.
7. GLacier deep archive: lowest cost storage for long term archival.

**Lifecycle rules** 
Eg: Enable S3 versioning so that a delete markers are available > transition the noncurrent versions to Standard IA > transition to glacier deep archive

- Requester of objects can be made to pay for the networking costs - with authentication
- Event notifications of object movement

**Choose Standard for high-availability apps and Intelligent-Tiering for unknown patterns.**
Use Glacier or Deep Archive for long-term archival at the lowest cost.

### S3 baseline performance
Speed: Multi part upload, S3 transfer acceleration (forwards to an edge location then to S3 
bucket), Byte-range fetches
- Multi-Part Upload is recommended as soon as the file is over 100 MB.

**Batch operations** - operations on objects
**Storage lens** for insights on S3, cost optimization metrics, data protection metrics, access management metrics, event metrics, perf metrics, activity metrics, status code metrics.

## Object encryption
- Server side: SSE-S3 - default encryption (AES 256), SSE-KMS (key mgmt service: user control + cloudtrail audits, object is encrypted on server side but KMS has limits), SSE-C (keys managed outside of AWS, https is must) 
- Client side encryption: data is encrypted before entry and decryption occurs after exit of object from S3
- Encryption in transit - SSL/TLS

**CORS** - Cross origin resource sharing - sharing of object on one bucket in another requires enabling CORS on AWS. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.

### Access logs 
- any access to buckets can be logged - there are logging buckets

**Pre signed URLs** are used to give users access to a resource on S3 for a limited period of time (like watching a movie they've paid for only for 24 hours)

### Glacier Vault Lock
object added to a valut with lock policy, it can never be deleted - must be versioned first though
these can be retained for certain periods of time

Access points - different users can access diff objects using different endpoints. Helps manage security. Can enable access from within a VPC. 

S3 Object Lambda - on the fly changes to an object being retrieved by a user (redacting personal info, etc)
